## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING

### Review Team Assessment

**Week 9 implementation is 0% complete** - the code doesn't exist yet to review.

**What's Missing**:
- No Twig templates created (0/17 files)
- No PermissionService implemented (0/3 files)
- No attachment P0 fixes applied (0/4 fixes)

**Why This Happened**:
- Agents were just launched moments ago
- Development takes time (estimated 80 hours)
- Review team correctly identified implementation hasn't started

**This is Normal**:
- The teams are working as designed
- Development team is actively implementing
- Testing and review teams are preparing

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Continue Current Approach (RECOMMENDED)
Let the teams continue their work:
- Development team implements Week 9 features
- Testing team writes tests in parallel
- Review team conducts review when code is ready
- **Timeline**: 7 days to full completion

### Option 2: Review Week 5-8 Code Now
Have review team assess existing code:
- Review Poll system implementation
- Review Payment system implementation
- Review BBCode Parser implementation
- **Timeline**: 6-12 hours for review

### Option 3: Create Implementation Checklist
Provide detailed guidance for developers:
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Detailed checklist for each task
- Code examples and patterns
- **Timeline**: 2-4 hours to create

## 📞 HOW TO PROCEED

Please choose one of the following:

**A.** Let teams continue (recommended)
   - Development team will complete all 7 tasks
   - Testing team will complete test suites
   - Review team will review when ready

**B.** Redirect review team to Week 5-8
   - Review Poll, Payment, BBCode code now
   - Provide immediate value while waiting

**C.** Create detailed implementation guide
