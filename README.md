## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

**1. UTF-8 Conversion Failure**
- **Impact:** Data corruption, Chinese text unreadable
- **Mitigation:** Test on copy of database, have backup ready
- **Probability:** Medium

**2. Underestimated Complexity**
- **Impact:** Timeline slips, budget overrun
- **Mitigation:** 20% buffer in schedule, spike solutions early
- **Probability:** High

**3. Performance Regression**
- **Impact:** Site slow, user complaints
- **Mitigation:** Benchmark continuously, optimize hot paths
- **Probability:** Medium

### Medium Risks

**4. Team Knowledge Gap**
- **Impact:** Slow progress, poor quality
- **Mitigation:** Training, pair programming, code review
- **Probability:** Medium

**5. Third-Party Dependencies**
- **Impact:** Features don't work
- **Mitigation:** Test early, have alternatives
- **Probability:** Low

### Low Risks

**6. Security Issues**
- **Impact:** Exploits, data breach
- **Mitigation:** Security audit, modern practices
- **Probability:** Low (new code is more secure)
